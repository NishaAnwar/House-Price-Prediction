## House Price Prediction  

This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature scaling, and model training using different regression algorithms. The key steps include:  

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values using median imputation and scaling features using `StandardScaler`.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing feature distributions and correlations.  
- **Splitting Data:** Dividing the dataset into training and test sets using both custom and `train_test_split` methods.  
- **Model Training:** Implementing `LinearRegression`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`, and `RandomForestRegressor` to predict house prices.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Using RMSE and cross-validation to assess model performance and avoid overfitting.  

This project provides a foundational approach to regression-based machine learning for real estate price prediction.
